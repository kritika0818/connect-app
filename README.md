## Connect App

**Connect App** is a mobile application I’ve built using **React Native** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **PostgreSQL** for the backend. It’s designed to help users **sign up, log in, manage their profiles**, and explore different **event types** — all through a clean and smooth interface.

This is a full-stack project I’ve crafted to combine both frontend and backend skills into one cohesive app!

## What You Can Do

- **Create an account** or **log in** securely  
- **Edit your profile**, including uploading a profile picture  
- **Browse and explore event types** through a tab-based interface  
- All data is connected to a **PostgreSQL database** via custom-built REST APIs

## Tech Used

- React Native (with Expo)
- React Navigation
- Redux (for state management)

**Backend**:
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL (hosted on Railway)
- Prisma ORM

**Other Tools**:
- Firebase (for image uploads)

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to create a real-world, full-stack app that brings together everything I’ve learned — from mobile UI and navigation to building secure APIs and managing a database. This project is part of my journey to becoming a better developer and building apps that feel good to use.
